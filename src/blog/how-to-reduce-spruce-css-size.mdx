<p className="lead">We try to make Spruce CSS smaller but still, we talk about 1000+ lines of code. Sometimes we donâ€™t need all of them.</p>

This framework only writes out any code if we tell it explicitly through a mixin. We call these mixins generators. We can control the size of our codebase by using or omitting them.

Usually, we use `generate-styles`:

```scss
@use 'sprucecss/scss/spruce' as *;

@include generate-styles;
```

and we configure what to generate through the `$generators` map.

You can see that from the [source code](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/blob/main/scss/mixin/_generator.scss) that these mixin contains a lot of condition based on the [previously mentioned map](/docs/sass/variables/#generators).

```scss
@use 'sprucecss/scss/spruce' with (
  $generators: (
    'form': (
      'btn': false,
    ),
  ),
);
```

Using this setting we turn off the button style generation.
