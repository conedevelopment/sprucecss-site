<p className="lead">Spruce has some print-related styles. Nothing severe or fancy, but a set of minimal styles.</p>

You can turn on basic print styles from the `$settings` map; set the `print` to `true` to turn it on.

```scss
@use '~sprucecss/scss/spruce' with (
  $settings: (
    print: true
  )
);
```

[Print-related variables](/docs/sass/variables#print).

**You get the following with the print styles:**
- with the `$print-page-margin` variable (default value: 2cm), you can control the margin of the page.
- With the `$print-hidden-elements`, you can hide elements from print view.
- You get the URLs of the links after `<a>` elements.
