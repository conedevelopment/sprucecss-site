<p className="lead">A straightforward administration template with standard views and many components.</p>

The Root theme is minimalistic, still containing many things that can be handy when you build a fully-fledged administration app.

The template is used in our Laravel admin package named [Root](https://root.conedevelopment.com/), so it will probably change regularly.

**We used [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) to handle the JS code.** Although there are some quite complete JS behaviors, this template is still static HTML/CSS, so you have to tackle the back-end and front-end functionality.

## What's in the Box 📦

The admin template comes with dark mode support that you can switch at the user menu by default.

**Right now, you can grab the following views or layouts:**

- [Dashboard](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/)
- [Product List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/products/)
- [Order List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/orders/)
- [Customer List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/customers/)
- [Category List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/categories/)
- [Item Edit](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/item/edit/)
- [Item View](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/item/view/)
- [Settings](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/settings/)
- [Sign In](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/sign-in/)
- [Sign Up](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/sign-up/)
- [Password Reset](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/password-reset/)

**There are a lot of admin-specific components:**

- A reusable modal component.
- Data table block with search and filter support.
- A simple in-text search.
- Various drop-down menus for context actions.
- Widget cards to display data and graphs.
- Media handler modal to list and handle your images.
- Combobox for multi-select purposes.
