<p className="lead">A straightforward administration template with standard views and lots of components.</p>

The template is used in our Laravel admin package named [Root](https://root.conedevelopment.com/), so it will probably change regularly in the future.

## What You Get

We used [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) to handle the JS code. Although there are some quite complete JS behaviors, this template is still static HTML/CSS, so you have to do the interactive part.

**Right now, you can grab the following views or layouts:**

- [Dashboard](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/)
- [Product List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/products/)
- [Order List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/orders/)
- [Customer List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/customers/)
- [Category List](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/categories/)
- [Item Edit](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/item/edit/)
- [Item View](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/item/view/)
- [Settings](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/settings/)
- [Sign In](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/sign-in/)
- [Sign Up](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/sign-up/)
- [Password Reset](https://root-admin.sprucecss.com/password-reset/)

**There are a lot of admin-specific components:**

- Modal window with customizations.
- Data table block with search and filter support.
- Simple search.
- Various drop-down menus.
- Widget cards.
- Media handler modal.
- Combobox.
