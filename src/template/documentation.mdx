<p className="lead">Welcome to the official documentation of **Spruce Docs** Elventy theme. A small template you can use to document any of your projects.</p>

A documentation template is always helpful. There are a lot of solutions to make one; we wanted to create our self-hosted version based on our favorite static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

By structure, it is simple, with two levels and additional custom templates like [FAQ](https://eleventy-documentation.sprucecss.com/faq/) and [Changelog](https://eleventy-documentation.sprucecss.com/changelog/).

## Features

- Breadcrumb navigation built on [11ty Navigation Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/).
- HTML minification in production mode.
- Anchor headings.
- Table of Content.
- FAQ template.
- Changelog template.
- Static search integration with [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/).
- Code highlighting.
- RTL support.
- Dark theme mode.
- [svgIcon](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss-eleventy-documentation-template/blob/main/src/shortcodes/svg-icon.js) shortcode: render any SVG icon inline and add optional classes.
- [markdownRenderer](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss-eleventy-documentation-template/blob/main/src/shortcodes/markdown-render.js): render any string (markdown) into HTML.

## Content Management

Adding content to the template is easy as almost everything is in Eleventy.

### The Basic Structure

Our base folder for the documentation pages is the `posts` folder. You must follow the folder structure, which means the `category` here. If you create a folder, you must make a list page with the same name as the folder. You must also create another `posts` folder under the `category` folder where your posts go. You must create the `posts.json` file that will parameter your `layout` and `permalink` values.

### Eleventy Navigation

The theme utilizes the [Eleventy Navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/), so you must explicitly set up the hierarchy. This is needed for the automatic sidebar navigation, the navigation order, and breadcrumb generation.

### Other Pages

To create simple pages, make a file directly under the `src` folder and configure it with the available front matter.
